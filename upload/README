Requires various tools, not limited to Moses (SMT Toolkit), OpenFST (C++ FST Library) and METEOR (word aligner)

Compiling with OpenFST (is independent of other stages) looks like:
	g++ cn.cpp process_meteor.cpp -ldl /usr/local/lib/libfst.so -std=c++11

For the Moses scripts,
	PJ must be set to project directory, containing corpus, working, lm folder hierachies 
	MO must be set to mosesdecoder directory
	MOSES must be set to the Moses decoder executlable ($MO/bin/moses)
